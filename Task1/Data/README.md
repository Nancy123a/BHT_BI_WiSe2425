# DATA!

Add any data you want others to have access to.

Try to keep it relatively lightweight

Storm Data: 
    https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/legacy/
    https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp


Note the TornadoEventData and WildfireEventData csv contain no events ending after our AOL database. Additionally, they contain no columns that are composed entirely of NAs. Aside from that, the data sheet should still apply.
